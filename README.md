Assignment 5
To implement binary search, bubble sort algorithm and to check if the input is palindrome

Reference link : https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_apply.asp

Binary Search:
- Given an array, find the midpoint of the array elements
- If the element to be searched is smaller than the midpoint, search on left side of array
- if the element to be searched is bigger than the midpoint, search on the right side of the array
- Return the index of the element searched

Bubble Sort:
- Iterate over all the elements in the given array
- Choose the first element as the smallest one 
- Compare the first element with the other elements of the array
- If the first element is greater than the next element then swap the two elements
- Display the sorted list of elements

Palindrome check:
- Check the length of the string 
- Iterate over the string 
- Reverse each element of the string
- Display the reversed string
